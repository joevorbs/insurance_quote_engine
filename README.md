## Insurance Quote Engine

### The code in this repo is used to build and run the insurance quote engine. It has 2 main functions:
  - Extract information from a spreadsheet populated by google forms that is required to build auto insurance quotes
  - Use extracted information to populate auto insurance software to automatically generate quotes
 
#### With an automated pipeline to produce quotes, the agent should save hours of time upon generating quotes for customers
